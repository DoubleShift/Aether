/**
 * The one and only Aether colour scheme: a light, near-white UI.
 *
 * ## Why Material You / dynamic colour is gone
 *
 * Every build up to 1.2.7 called `dynamicColorScheme(context)` on Android 12+,
 * so from Android 12 on the entire app was repainted from the user's WALLPAPER.
 * That is a lovely default for a launcher and the wrong one for this app: half
 * the app came out in whatever hue the wallpaper happened to imply - lilac,
 * olive, terracotta - differently on every phone, and impossible to design
 * against.
 *
 * The scheme is now fixed and hand-built from the [BgPage]..[LineDisabled] ramp,
 * so the app looks identical on every device and every Android version, exactly
 * like the big vendors' own system apps do. The surface roles are mapped to the
 * elevation ramp rather than to alpha, which is what stops a card inside a sheet
 * from double-lightening.

/**
 * Wraps the app in the Aether theme.
 *
 * ## The layout direction is FORCED here, and that is the fix
 *
 * It used to be left to "the configuration of the context", which reads like the
 * right answer and is not one. Compose does not lay out from the configuration:
 * `AndroidComposeView` overrides `onRtlPropertiesChanged`, so the direction it
 * uses is whatever the VIEW hierarchy resolved - and the decor view at the top of
 * that hierarchy resolves it against `Locale.getDefault()`, which the framework
 * rewrites from the *activity's* locale list on bind, on resume and on every
 * configuration change, long after `attachBaseContext` set ours.
 *
 * With a Persian phone the value the framework wrote back was Persian anyway, so
 * the mirroring looked correct and hid the bug. With an ENGLISH phone and the app
 * set to Persian it wrote `en` back over our `fa`: the decor view resolved LTR,
 * handed that to Compose, and the entire UI laid out left-to-right while reading
 * in Persian. That is the reported bug, and it is why it appeared in that one
 * combination only.
 *
 * `LocalLayoutDirection` is therefore pinned from the stored language choice
 * ([LanguagePrefs.isRtl]) and nothing else. One provider at the root covers the
 * whole app - including `Dialog`, `Popup`, `DropdownMenu` and `ModalBottomSheet`,
 * which read `LocalLayoutDirection.current` and apply it to their own windows -
 * so every screen, row, icon, slider and sheet mirrors together. Individual
 * technical fields still opt back out to LTR on purpose (see `LtrOutlinedTextField`).
 *
 * The typeface follows the same single source of truth: Persian gets the bundled
 * Vazirmatn face across the whole type scale, English keeps the stock one.
